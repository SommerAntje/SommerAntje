##  _Hi, welcome to my profile_  &#9996; 



I am Antje, a former graphic designer by profession and self-taught front-end developer based in Hamburg. With a focus on online shop software development, I have worked as UI/UX designer and front-end developer in e-commerce for many years. As an autodidact I decided to follow my passion for consistent learning and to specialize focusing on vue.js, Jamstack architecture and MVP development concept. Apart from being a nerd, I am also an autodidactic guitarist (bloody beginner level) and enthusiastic about learning dutch.
